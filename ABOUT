Agent
=====

Idea
----

We persused the following idea:

  - minimax search
  - alpha-beta pruning
  - various others that didn't make it in the final bot

Implementation
--------------

Our agent was written as follows:

  - (at least) 50% after 12am, 100% on medically unadvisory levels of caffeine
  - some implementation details from the example python agent were used as a reference, in particular concerning KGP
    parsing and game state handling

CAVEATS
-------

Note the that there might be complications if:

  - hahaha, when will there ever be not?
