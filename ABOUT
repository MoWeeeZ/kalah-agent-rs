Agent
=====

Idea
----

We persused the following idea:

  - minimax search
  - alpha-beta pruning
  - some implementation details from the example python agent, in particular KGP parsing and game state handling

Implementation
--------------

Our agent was written as follows:

  WRITEME (obligatory)

CAVEATS
-------

Note the that there might be complications if:

  - I fucked up (which I probably did) and am unlucky enough to hit that one edge case I didn't consider :)

Team

List all students that participate in our group are:

- Moritz Gmeiner (eg94ifeh)

- [ ] Our agent connects to localhost:2671 by default.
- [X] Your program does not depend on non-free software.
- [ ] Any additional dependencies have been specified in the

      of our team.
