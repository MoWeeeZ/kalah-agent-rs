Agent
=====

Idea
----

We persused the following idea:

  - minimax search
  - alpha-beta pruning

Implementation
--------------

Our agent was written as follows:

  - 50% after 12am, 100% on medically unadvisory levels of caffeine
  - some implementation details from the example python agent were used as a reference, in particular concerning KGP
    parsing and game state handling

CAVEATS
-------

Note the that there might be complications if:

  - I fucked up (which I probably did) and am unlucky enough to hit that one edge case I didn't consider :)

Team
====

List all students that participate in our group are:

- Moritz Gmeiner (eg94ifeh)
